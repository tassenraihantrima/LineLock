# LineLock Coding Journal

This journal records the development process, technologies, challenges, and lessons learned while building LineLock.

---

## Phase 1 — Project Foundation

### What I did

- Created and cloned the public LineLock GitHub repository.
- Created a React and TypeScript frontend using Vite.
- Created a Node.js and TypeScript backend.
- Installed Express for backend routes and API handling.
- Installed Socket.IO to prepare for future real-time multiplayer communication.
- Installed CORS so the frontend and backend can communicate while running on different local ports.
- Installed dotenv to support private environment variables later.
- Configured TypeScript compilation for the backend.
- Added a backend health-check route.
- Added a basic Socket.IO connection listener.
- Added a simple LineLock landing page.
- Created root npm scripts that run the frontend and backend together.
- Added a project-wide `.gitignore`.
- Replaced the starter README with project-specific documentation.

### Technologies used

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Node.js
- Express
- Socket.IO
- CORS
- dotenv
- tsx
- concurrently
- Git
- GitHub

### What I learned

- A full-stack application can keep its frontend and backend in separate folders inside one repository.
- Each part of the application can have its own `package.json`.
- The root `package.json` can coordinate commands across the entire project.
- Express handles regular HTTP routes and API requests.
- Socket.IO uses the HTTP server to support real-time communication.
- CORS permissions are required when the frontend and backend run on different ports.
- TypeScript configuration controls how backend source files are compiled.
- Development dependencies are tools required for building and running the project locally, while production dependencies are used by the application itself.
- A health-check endpoint provides a simple way to verify that the backend is available.

### Problems or challenges

- The project contains three `package.json` files, so it was important to understand the purpose of each one.
- The frontend and backend use different local ports.
- The backend required an HTTP server wrapper because Socket.IO will eventually share the same server as Express.
- Configuration files needed to be placed in the correct folders.

### How I verified the phase

- Ran the React frontend at `http://localhost:5173`.
- Ran the backend at `http://localhost:3001`.
- Opened the backend root route and received a successful JSON response.
- Opened `/api/health` and received an `"ok"` status.
- Ran both applications together using the root `npm run dev` command.
- Confirmed that the frontend landing page rendered successfully.

### Next phase

In Phase 2, I will define the core Dots and Boxes game rules and TypeScript data models. This will include:

- Player data
- Horizontal and vertical edges
- Boxes
- Board dimensions
- Current turn
- Scores
- Game status
- Rules for completing one or two boxes
- Rules for receiving an additional turn after claiming a box
